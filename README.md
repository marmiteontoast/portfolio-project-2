- # Design

    - ## colour Scheme

        - The site has three main colours black, white and purple.

    - ## Typography

        - The main font for the site is Roboto with Sans-Serif as fallback and the heading is using the font Bangers, using cursive as its fallback. i used the fallback fonts Sans-serif and cursive because most browsers will be compatiable with it.

- ### Game Buttons

    - The user can clearly see the three choices of rock, paper, and scissors.

    - The use of font awesome icons for my buttons stands out and attracts the user. 

    - Using icons for the buttons gives a clear understanding what the user is pressing. 

    - The mouse curser changes to a pointer so the user understands that this is a button.

    - Buttons also scales when the user hovers over it with the mouse. It's striking and will attract the users attention.
