- ### Game Buttons

    -  the user can clearly see the three choices of rock, paper, and scissors

    - The use of font awesome icons for my buttons stands out and attracts the user 

    - using icons for the buttons gives a clear understanding what the user is pressing 

    - the mouse curser changes to a pointer so the user understands that this is a button

    - button also scales when the user hovers over it with the mouse. It's striking and will attract the users attention.

- ## Accessibility

    - I have confirmed that the font styles are readable, and accessibility is a high percentage using lighthouse in devtools.

<h2><img src='assets/images/light_house_img.png'></h2>

## unfixed Bugs

The JSHint says there is a "unused variable" on the page, which is the reStart variable, but it is in fact being used within my  reStart function. I reached out to people on slack and they say i  could be happening beacuse i have multiple scripts and the validator can't identify which one it belongs to.
